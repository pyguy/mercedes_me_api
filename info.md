The Home Assistant Custom Component is a component to be added in Home Assistant in order to integrate the sensors of a Mercedes-Benz car using [Mercedes me API](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products).
This component is still in development.

## Pre-Requirements
1) Own a Mercedes Benz Car with Mercedes me installed and working.
2) Create an application in https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/
3) Register to the following APIs:
   - [Electric Vehicle Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/electric_vehicle_status)
   - [Fuel Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/fuel_status)
   - [Pay As You Drive Insurance](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/pay_as_you_drive_insurance) 
   - [Vehicle Lock Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/vehicle_lock_status)
   - [Vehicle Status](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/products/vehicle_status)

Notes: 
1) the APIs described above do not require any subscription in case you use them with your own car associated with the Mercedes me Account.
2) not all sensors may be available in your own car; if a sensor is not available the data request returns no data.
3) only one car is supported for the moment.

## Open Points & Issues
- Complete OAUTH2 Authentication & Get the First Token
- Get state after starts -> now it waits <scan_interval> seconds.
- Config Flow for automatic configuration
- Log Management
- Bugfix & Software optimizations

For further details please refer to [issues list][issues-url].

{% if not installed %}
## Installation
To use this custom component it's necessary to perform the following instructions:
1) clone the repository
2) create make a symbolic link from git_repost/custom_components/mercedesmeapi to hass_folder/custom_components

{% endif %}
## Configuration
1) Add in the configuration.yaml the following emelents:
```yaml
mercedesmeapi:
  client_id: <**INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID**>
  client_secret: <**INSERT_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET**>
  vehicle_id: <**INSERT_YOUR_VEHICLE_ID**>
  enable_resources_file: <**ENABLE (true) OR DISABLE (false) RESOURCES - OPTIONAL (DEFAULT DISABLED)**>
  scan_interval: <** TIME PERIOD (NUMBER OF SECONDS) TO REFRESH RESOURCES - OPTIONAL**>
```
2) Actually it's not possible to retrieve the token from scratch. Please use the other scripts to retrieve the first token and copy it (.mercedesme_token) into the homeassistant configuration folder, in the same path where configuration.yaml is located 

## Debug
To enable advanced log please expand the logger module configuration with the following lines:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.mercedesmeapi: debug
```
